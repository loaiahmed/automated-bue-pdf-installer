a python script that uses selenium to automate the installation of all my semester course materials into organized folders
from the BUE elearning website

if you are a BUE student you can use it by installing the required packages...which is just selenium for now lol
you have to have an account then modify the script by going to main.py and modifying the directory_path and the payload variable
otherwise it wouldnt work =)

quick note: the payload variable has the username and password the script will use to log in

almost forgot you should also have chrome and install a chrome driver witht the same version as your chrome browser
you can check your chrome version by searching in chrome::version


python used:
python                    3.12.0

python packages installed:
selenium                  3.141.0

requirments:
chrome browser
chrome driver
